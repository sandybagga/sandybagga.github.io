                        design opportunities for improvement in either internal or client-facing operations.</p>
                    <p class="p2">After 2 months of research using methods including cultural probes and a co-design workshop, my team
                        devised a
                        <a href="#fig-1">digital solution (fig. 1)</a> that could help makercube in their pursuit of creating a community
                        with greater knowledge sharing and training, as well as incentivizing members to gain skills at their
                        own pace.
