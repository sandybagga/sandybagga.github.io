                <p id="p1">As part of a course project, my team and I conducted design research with Maker Cube, a
                    makerspace in
                    the greater Vancouver area. Maker Cube was in the process of transitioning from a non- to a
                    for-profit operation and this provided an opportunity to create value for members, new and
                    incoming, through design.</p>
                <p id="p2">We began by discussing how prospective and incoming members interact with Maker Cube and
                    qualitatively outlined their experience using empathy and journey maps. The <strong>empathy map</strong>
                    provided an overall sense of how a member might feel throughout their interactions, whereas the
                    <strong>journey map</strong> provided a more specific temporal overview.</p>

                </figure>
                <p id="p3">The journey map also included <strong>touchpoints</strong> to ensure that the exercise would
                    result in a
                    feasible and viable opening for my team's design intervention. I took the responsibility of
                    managing
                    the scope of the projcet in these discussions as well as ensuring that the brand that the Maker
                    Cube
                    team wanted to communicate to the public maintained its integrity in our intervention.</p>

            <div class="grid" id="define-section">
                <h2 class="section-heading" id="define-heading">Define</h2>
                <p id="p1">With the co-founders' goals in mind and a better sense of an opportunity for a design-driven
                    intervention, my team and I conducted additional research with the existing members at Maker Cube
                    to validate the assumptions we made in the discovery stage.</p>
                <p id="p2">One of our methods of research were cultural probes. A <strong>cultural probe</strong> is a
                    qualitative method of research that identifies the ways in which the user experience is affected,
                    both positively and
                    negatively.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/makercube/probe-overview.JPG" alt="the three activities for the cultural probe laid out">
                    <figcaption>Fig. 2. Cultural Probe</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p id="p3">Our cultural probe (fig. 2) involved three activities: a sketchbook with prompts, photo
                    frames to help
                    participants document process on their active projects, and a map which they could annotate and
                    plan
                    the ideal makerspace.</p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Fig. 3. A page from the completed Cultural Probe</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p id="p4">After collecting the completed cultural probes and synthesizing the results, we found that
                    community
                    engagement and knowledge sharing (fig. 3) were the main points of focus for the members and
                    facilitators at Makercube. We decided to design a solution to help cultivate, maintain, and
                    maximize
                    these connections.</p>
                <figure id="persona">

                            all three ></a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p id="p5">To focus our development stage, we generated three personas from the synthesized probe
                    results (fig. 4), each on a spectrum of maker experience. Since the new for-profit business model
                    meant that member retention was now more important than ever, our intervention could not focus
                    solely on incoming members.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid" id="develop-section">
                <h2 class="section-heading" id="develop-heading">Develop</h2>
                <p id="p1">As we were developing our solution, we found that Maker Cube were ideating on new ways to
                    onboard new members once their transition to the for-profit business model was complete. In our
                    correspondence, we found that they wanted a handbook with information on all the equipment they had
                    available and a short manifesto on the kind of community they seek to cultivate.</p>
                <p id="p2">We saw this as added incentive for a digital intervention. We storyboarded a feasible
                    experiential flow (fig. 5) that hit the community goals we had set for ourselves since the empathy
                    map in
                    the discovery stage.</p>

                <p id="p3">The storyboard illustrated how a new maker might connect with a more experience maker in the
                    Maker Cube community, and how it might be facilitated digitally. I designed the user experience for
                    each user, and then refined it for the final deliverable (fig. 6).</p>

                <p id="p1">Our solution consisted of two parts: the companion app and the digial kiosk. The feature
                    common to both is a feature that lets members mark themselves available and accessible to help
                    other members with a discipline in which they are an expert. This was designed to drive up
                    engagement and knowledge sharing in the Maker Cube community.</p>

                </figure>
                <p id="p2">The Maker Cube companion app (fig. 4) lets users chat with other makers in the space who have
                    marked themselves as available for help. Other features include viewing and registering for
                    upcoming workshops, and a hyperlinked, wiki-style handbook.</p>
                <p id="p3">The kiosk interface allows users to sign in using their RFID-enabled membership card or key
                    fob, depending on the type of membership. Once they sign in, the user can set their availability
                    (fig. 5), which would correspond to their availability as it appears on the Companion app.</p>

                </figure>
                <p id="p4">At the end of this semester-long process, my team and I were able to not only effectively
                    diagnose and communicate a business problem, but also deliver a solution that delivers an applied
                    system that aligns with Maker Cube's priority: cultivating a community of creatives where exchange
                    of ideas and skills is encouraged. The founders at Maker Cube have expressed interest in
                    implementing our design and taking this project out of its originally intended course context.</p>
