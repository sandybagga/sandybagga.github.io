            <p>When I started my term at Visier, two of the flagship products, Workforce Planning (WFP) and Workforce Analytics
                (WFA) displayed plans and analyses, respectively, as a list. These lists, however, were not consistent in
                their information architecture: plans (fig. 1) were listed in multiple buckets with multiple points of metadata,
                whereas analyses (fig. 2) were listed as simplified links. Additionally, WFP was being ported to the platform
                upon which WFA was based.</p>

            <h3>Design Approach</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-body" id="approach-desc">
            <p>In an effort to bring a modular UX design approach to the organization, I worked to design a consistent information
                architecture for showing items as a list. The first step towards achieving this was to extract out points
                of metadata (fig. 3) and actions common to list items in each product. I subsequently took measures to ensure
                that this component was reusable in its implementation, which included prototyping, as well as making sure
                that the interface was flexible enough to respond to novel contexts and potential visual redesigns.</p>

            <h3>Roadblock</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-body" id="roadblock-desc">
            <p>In WFP, users can share plans with other users, as well as assign them to users as tasks. To manage the multiple
                scenarios (eg. plans the user has assigned, plans assigned to the user, plans the user has shared with another,
                and so on), the information architecture was split up into multiple buckets, one per such a case. Although
                search worked across all the buckets, this made navigation, scanning, and performing batch actions unintuitive.</p>

        <div class="section-body" id="detour-desc">
            <p>In collaboration with the stakeholders, I made the decision introduce a more robust notion of authorship​. It
                was agreed that the bucketing system needed to be retained. But with the introduction of authorship it could
                be tempered. For instance, “My Plans” and “Plans shared with me” could be listed under “Plans” and distinguished
                by supplementarily surfacing the author of the plan.</p>

            <p>Rather than stress testing the completed using a complex workflow, I started with said complex workflow (fig.
                4) and circumambulated it to ensure that the design serves its purpose.</p>

            <p>The reorganization of the information architecture, the introduction of authorship, and a new complex workflow
                culminated in the completion of the final spec (fig 5). The project imparted knowledge on designing microinteractions
                under an overarching narrative and a modular approach to UX design that results in reusable components that
                are effective, yet efficient.</p>
