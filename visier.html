                    <p class="p1">When I started my term at Visier, two of the flagship products, Workforce Planning (WFP) and Workforce
                        Analytics (WFA) displayed plans and analyses, respectively, as a list. These lists, however, were
                        not consistent in their information architecture:
                        <a href="#fig-2">plans (fig. 2)</a> were listed in multiple buckets with multiple points of metadata, whereas
                        <a href="#fig-3">analyses (fig. 3)</a> were listed as simplified links. Additionally, WFP was being ported to the
                        platform upon which WFA was based.</p>

                    <p class="p1">In an effort to bring a modular UX design approach to the organization, I worked to design a consistent
                        information architecture for showing items as a list. The first step towards achieving this was to
                        extract out points of
                        <a href="#fig-4">metadata (fig. 4)</a> and actions common to list items in each product. I subsequently took measures
                        to ensure that this component was reusable in its implementation, which included prototyping, as
                        well as making sure that the interface was flexible enough to respond to novel contexts and potential
                        visual redesigns.</p>

                        In WFP, users can share plans with other users, as well as assign them to users as tasks. To manage the multiple scenarios
                        (eg. plans the user has assigned, plans assigned to the user, plans the user has shared with another,
                        and so on), the information architecture was split up into multiple buckets, one per such a case.
                        Although search worked across all the buckets, this made navigation, scanning, and performing batch
                        actions unintuitive.

                    <p class="p1">In collaboration with the stakeholders, I made the decision introduce a more robust notion of authorship​.
                        It was agreed that the bucketing system needed to be retained. But with the introduction of authorship
                        it could be tempered. For instance, “My Plans” and “Plans shared with me” could be listed under “Plans”
                        and distinguished by supplementarily surfacing the author of the plan.</p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Rather than stress testing the completed using a complex workflow, I started with said
