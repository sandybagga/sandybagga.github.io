                        design practices.

                <p id="visier-challenge-p1">When I started my term at Visier, two of the flagship products, Workforce
                    Planning (WFP) and
                    Workforce Analytics (WFA) displayed plans and analyses, respectively, as a list. These lists,
                    however, were not consistent in their information architecture: plans (fig. 2) were listed in
                    multiple buckets with multiple points of metadata, whereas analyses (fig. 3) were listed as
                    simplified links. Additionally, WFP was being ported to the platform upon which WFA was based.

                <h2 class="section-heading" id="develop-heading">Approach</h2>
                <p id="p1">In an effort to bring a modular UX design approach to the organization, I worked to design a
                    consistent information architecture for showing items as a list. The first step towards achieving
                    this was to extract out points of metadata (fig. 4) and actions common to list items in each
                    product. I subsequently took measures to ensure that this component was reusable in its
                    implementation, which included prototyping, as well as making sure that the interface was flexible
                    enough to respond to novel contexts and potential visual redesigns.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig. 4. Reconciling metadata between plans and analyses</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p id="p2">In WFP, users can share plans with other users, as well as assign them to users as tasks. To
                    manage the multiple scenarios (eg. plans the user has assigned, plans assigned to the user, plans
                    the user has shared with another, and so on), the information architecture was split up into
                    multiple buckets, one per such a case. Although search worked across all the buckets, this made
                    navigation, scanning, and performing batch actions unintuitive.
                </p>

            <div class="grid visier-deliver" id="deliver-section">
                <h2 class="section-heading" id="deliver-heading">Solution</h2>
                <p id="p1">In collaboration with the stakeholders, I made the decision introduce a more robust notion
                    of authorship​. It was agreed that the bucketing system needed to be retained. But with the
                    introduction of authorship it could be tempered. For instance, “My Plans” and “Plans shared with
                    me” could be listed under “Plans” and distinguished by supplementarily surfacing the author of the
                    plan.
                </p>
                <p id="p2">Rather than stress testing the completed solution using a complex workflow, I started with said
                    complex workflow (fig. 5) and circumambulated it to ensure that the design serves its purpose.</p>

                </figure>
                <p id="p4">The reorganization of the information architecture, the introduction of authorship, and a
                    new complex workflow culminated in the completion of the final spec (fig. 6). The project imparted
                    knowledge on designing microinteractions under an overarching narrative and a modular approach to
                    UX design that results in reusable components that are effective, yet efficient.
